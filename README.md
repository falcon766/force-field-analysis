# Force Field Analysis App

A beautiful web-based application for conducting Force Field Analysis - a decision-making technique developed by Kurt Lewin that helps analyze the forces for and against a change or decision.

## Features

- Create and analyze decisions using the Force Field Analysis framework
- Add, edit, and delete driving forces (factors pushing toward change)
- Add, edit, and delete restraining forces (factors pushing against change)
- Assign strength scores (1-5) to each force
- Visualize the balance of forces with an interactive visualization
- Calculate total scores and net force
- Save analyses to local storage
- Export analyses as PDF documents
- Responsive design for all devices

## How to Use

1. Enter the decision or change you're analyzing in the input field at the top
2. Add driving forces (factors supporting the change) in the left column
3. Add restraining forces (factors opposing the change) in the right column
4. Assign a strength score (1-5) to each force
5. View the calculated scores and visualization
6. Use the action buttons to save, export, or clear your analysis

## Getting Started

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the application. No installation or setup required.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- jsPDF (for PDF export)
- html2canvas (for visualization export)
- Local Storage API (for saving analyses)

## About Force Field Analysis

Force Field Analysis is a decision-making technique developed by Kurt Lewin. It helps identify and analyze the forces that support (driving forces) and oppose (restraining forces) a change or decision. By understanding these forces, you can develop strategies to strengthen the driving forces and/or weaken the restraining forces to make your change more successful.
